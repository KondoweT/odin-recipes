            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch casserole dish.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken breast in the prepared baking dish. Spread cream of mushroom soup evenly over chicken; generously sprinkle with Greek seasoning. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
